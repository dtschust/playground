# Temp app
This is a simple app with routing, API support, live reload and all that goodness.

## Live Demo
[✨DEMO ✨](https://dtschust.github.io/playground)
## Running the application
To run the app, clone the repo, install necessary packages, then start.
```sh
git clone git@github.com:dtschust/playground.git
cd playground
npm install
npm start
```
This will start in a developer environment at `http://localhost:3000`, which has live reload support. To test the static production build, run
```sh
npm run start-static
```

## Redux-Bug-Reporter Integration
Redux-Bug-Reporter is built in to this app. Locally or in the demo, feel free to file a bug and a github issue will be created. Don't worry, I don't mind the spam, try it out! When viewing the github issue, copy the playback script and paste it in the dev console of a demo page to replay the filed bug.
